            <p>One night, he had trouble falling asleep. His bedroom was the entire top floor of his house with his bed and such being on the left side and storage closets and a play area being on the right. He was lying in bed when he heard a noise from the other side of the room and see a rocking horse begin to rock. It was sitting just outside one of the storage closet doors. It proceeded to rock its way halfway across the room and stopped dead under the ceiling light. At this point he was freaking out and just buried his head under his blankets and never peeked out again until morning.</p>

            <p>It was all confirmed to not be a dream as the rocking horse was still in the middle of his room when he woke up. Furthermore, he got a stern reprimand from his parents for being up out of bed playing with my toys well past my bedtime. Their bedroom was directly below the storage closet/play area and had heard the creaking of the rocking horse shuffling across the room.</p>
